# Welcome to jasperroel.nl

All-round code monkey, loving (new) technology, designing and building solutions or debugging (performance) issues and finding the best solutions for 'm.

I love Java (and Android), but appreciate any language that will get the job done.

Also have a passion for security and debugging, and have worked a lot in the web world. Love the back-end and invisible gears of the things that make our online world turn.

I'm also super awesome human being! True!

## Projects

### VodafoneZiggo
Working as a Lead Developer, helping the Digital Development team improve.


### Yacht
Lead Developer for the IT club of juniors and senior within Yacht Amsterdam, called **Most Dev**.

### For fun: Docker
Docker in itself is already extremely powerful, but combining it with the new shiny functionality of Pipelines in Jenkins 2.0 (and using Blue Ocean to make it look gorgeous) it is a blast too use.

Looking to learn all the ecosystems that amazing people have build around it, like OpenShift (based on Kubernetes), Vamp.io and others.

### For fun: Everything around development.
Always interested in the business aspect of development ("why do we build this?")

## Previous work

### Salesforce.com
7 Years at Salesforce, from intern to Lead Member of Technisch Staff, working across three countries.
